### `yarn standalone start`

Runs the standalone app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

If you don't have an active LSP backend, you can test the frontend with a mocked backend.\
Open [http://localhost:3000/mock.html](http://localhost:3000/mock.html) to view mocked data.

The page will reload if you make edits, if you watch all packages.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `yarn standalone build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
